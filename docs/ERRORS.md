# NestyAI Error Contract Specification

This document details the standard error response shape and categorized list of error codes used by NestyAI.

---

## Standard Error Response Shape

All API errors return a standard JSON structure with HTTP status code matching the error condition (typically 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, or 5xx).

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.",
    "type": "api_error",
    "details": {
      "retry_after_seconds": 15
    }
  }
}
```

*   `code`: A machine-readable string identifying the error subclass.
*   `message`: A human-readable description of the error.
*   `type`: A stable error type identifier (e.g. `"api_error"`).
*   `details`: Optional payload providing structured context (e.g. validation issues, retry durations).

## Categorized Error Codes

### 1. Request Validation
*   `invalid_request`: The request payload was malformed or violates schema validation constraints (FastAPI `RequestValidationError` fallback).

### 2. Authorization & Keys
*   `missing_api_key`: The required API key was not supplied in headers.
*   `invalid_api_key`: The supplied API key is invalid or inactive.
*   `model_not_allowed`: The API key used is unauthorized to access the requested model alias.

### 3. Rate Limits & Quotas
*   `rate_limit_exceeded`: Rate limit threshold exceeded. Includes a `details.retry_after_seconds` field.
*   `daily_quota_exceeded`: The daily token/request budget for the API key has been exhausted.
*   `monthly_quota_exceeded`: The monthly token/request budget for the API key has been exhausted.

### 4. Provider Routing & Failures
*   `invalid_model`: The requested model alias is unrecognized.
*   `provider_unavailable`: An external API provider returned an error, timed out, or had credentials misconfigured.
*   `all_providers_failed`: All fallback providers configured for the requested route failed to respond.
*   `streaming_not_implemented`: Streaming was requested, but the provider backend does not implement it.
*   `streaming_not_supported`: Streaming was requested, but the provider backend does not support SSE.
*   `stream_interrupted`: The active SSE stream connection was unexpectedly dropped or severed by the provider.
*   `stream_provider_failed`: Standard fallback error for general failures during streaming.

### 5. Search & Tools
*   `invalid_search_mode`: Invalid `search` mode value supplied (must be one of: `"auto"`, `"on"`, `"off"`).
*   `search_failed`: The search query process failed.
*   `invalid_tools_mode`: Invalid `tools` mode value supplied (must be `"auto"`, `"off"`, or list of names).
*   `unknown_tool`: The tool requested is not present in the gateway's tool registry.
*   `tool_execution_failed`: An error occurred during tool execution runtime.
*   `tool_timeout`: The tool exceeded its execution time limit.
*   `tool_not_configured`: Tool credentials or prerequisite environment settings are missing.
*   `unsafe_url_blocked`: A tool attempted to request a URL that was flagged by safety guards.
*   `fetch_failed`: Web query or scraping tool was unable to retrieve a resource.

### 6. Conversations & History
*   `conversation_not_found`: The requested conversation was not found or is archived.
*   `conversation_access_denied`: The conversation belongs to a different API key.
*   `conversation_storage_failed`: An error occurred when persisting messages or updates to SQLite.
*   `invalid_conversation_request`: Invalid parameters supplied (e.g. pagination offsets or invalid query filters).

### 7. Summarization
*   `conversation_summary_failed`: Summarization strategy failed during LLM call.
*   `invalid_summary_mode`: Invalid `summary` mode value supplied (must be `"auto"`, `"off"`, `"force"`).

### 8. Semantic Recall & Memories
*   `invalid_semantic_recall_mode`: Invalid `semantic_recall` mode value (must be `"auto"`, `"on"`, `"off"`).
*   `semantic_recall_failed`: The semantic recall search operation failed.
*   `semantic_recall_unavailable`: Semantic recall was requested but the feature is disabled in server configurations.
*   `invalid_memory_control_request`: Memory control requested cannot be satisfied (e.g. pinning and excluding a message simultaneously).
*   `memory_control_update_failed`: Failed to write memory control edits to SQLite.

### 9. Embeddings
*   `embedding_provider_unavailable`: The configured vector embedder failed to respond.
*   `embedding_generation_failed`: Generation of text embeddings failed.
*   `embedding_storage_failed`: Storing the embedding record failed.

### 10. Security Guards
*   `context_sanitization_failed`: Safety scanning flagged excessive prompt injection patterns in external contexts.

### 11. Internal Admin Endpoints
*   `internal_admin_disabled`: Accessing admin paths when `INTERNAL_ADMIN_ENABLED=false`. Returns HTTP 404.
*   `internal_admin_unauthorized`: Invalid admin token or Authorization header format. Returns HTTP 401.
*   `model_config_not_found`: Config profile is not present in SQLite database.
*   `model_config_invalid`: The config schema is invalid.
*   `model_config_update_failed`: Failed to write model config overrides.
*   `model_config_test_failed`: Provider test verification returned errors.
*   `diagnostics_disabled`: Attempting to use diagnostics endpoints when disabled.
